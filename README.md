index.html:
The provided HTML code defines the structure of a web page for a currency converter. The document begins with the necessary HTML5 doctype declaration and sets the language attribute to "en" (English). The head section includes meta tags for character set and viewport settings, along with a title for the document. External stylesheets, including Font Awesome for icons, are linked to enhance the visual presentation.
Within the body, a main container with the class "container" holds the content. An H2 heading introduces the purpose of the page as a currency converter. The form element contains input fields, dropdowns for currency selection, and a button labeled "Get Exchange Rate." Flags representing currencies are displayed using images from the flagsapi.com service.

index.css:
The CSS styles provide a visually appealing layout. The body has a minimum height set to 100% of the viewport, and the container has a white background, padding, and rounded corners. The form elements, including inputs and selects, are styled for a uniform appearance. Dropdowns and flag displays are given specific styling, and a visual arrow icon is incorporated for design aesthetics.

index.js:
The JavaScript code, split between "codes.js" and "index.js," handles the dynamic functionality of the currency converter. Constants and variables are declared, including the base URL for currency exchange rate data and references to various HTML elements. Event listeners are implemented to respond to changes in dropdown selection and button clicks.
The functions defined in the JavaScript code include "updateExchangeRate," responsible for fetching and calculating exchange rates based on user input, and "updateFlag," which dynamically updates the flag image when a currency is selected. Additionally, there are event listeners for the window load event and button clicks to ensure the application's smooth functioning.
